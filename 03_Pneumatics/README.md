![](../images/OpenVentilatorLogoSmall.png) **ASSEMBLY GUIDE OF THE OPEN VENTILATOR - PNEUMATICS SECTION**

In this directory you can find the build descriptions and parts files for various pneumatics solutions. They are one part of the system as a whole. To get an overview of the system as a whole, see the [toplevel description](../SystemDescription.md) or the [assembly document](../Assembly.md).

**Pneumatic diagram**

The system as a whole has the following pneumatics diagram. Any solution you build, should be built according to this diagram. 

Note that no external pressurized air is needed. The flow driver (or pump) will create the required low air pressure and the volume needed.
