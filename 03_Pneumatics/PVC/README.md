This directory describes a way to build valves from PVC tubing parts.
It features:
- A [one-way valve](PVCOne-WayValveBuildDescription.md) (check valve)
- A [transistor valve](PVCTransistorValveBuildDescription.md) (valve that closes by pressure)

**This part is not part of the standard Spartan model.**

To create a working system, connect your valves according to the pneumatic diagram in the directory above this.
