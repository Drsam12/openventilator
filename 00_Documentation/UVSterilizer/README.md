This directory contains documentation on an air sterilizer that uses UV-C light.
It is to be placed in the exhaust channel of the air. 

UV-C light air sterilizer

Basic description

The idea is that all outgoing air is passed past a UV-C light, which sterilizes it. 
There are two types of UV-C lights, the ones that generate ozone, and the ones that don't. 
Make sure you have one that DOES NOT generate ozone. 
Best is to run a hose from the output of the water tank to a tube or container with the lamp inside. 
The lamp should not be visible, because the invisible UV-C light is bad for the eyes and skin. 
The air has to run through the lamp container and after that it's best to vent it outside the building 
(though normally not necessary, it's safer if the lamp fails). Multiple PEEP tanks can be connected to one lamp. 
If you connect a lot of PEEP tanks, choose a bigger lamp.
Next, there are two types of supplies for the lamps: high and low voltage.

    1. 110V/230V supply. Choose a 6 or 8 W tube lamp. For safety, the lamp should preferably not be close to the 
water of the PEEP tank. If possible connect the lamp to a separate group with a separate Residual Current Detector, 
so if it fails, it doesn't pull the power on the ventilators.

    2. 12V supply. These lamps are difficult to find, but can be composed of two parts that are easy to find. 
Part one is the housing and inverter, these can be taken from a model for boats and caravans, and just remove the normal 
tube. Part two is the UV-C tube, which should be a fitting 6W or 8W tube. Because of the low voltage and the isolation 
from the 110V/230V mains voltage, it is safer. And power supplies will normally recover from a short circuit.
