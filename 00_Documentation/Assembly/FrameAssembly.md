**Frame Assembly**

This is a very complicated part of the assembly. Altought it has several ways to be accomplished we reached so many dificulties on this step. This is why we recommend to assembly first the Bellow and the Gantry.

You can start by assembling on the lateral pannels the Linear Rod end-idler. This is important to be made first because the main frame chassi is perpendicular to this structure

Other problem you are going to find is to insert the rod in the gantry-carriage and the same time aligning the rod-idler with the lateral chassi and the main chassi.
