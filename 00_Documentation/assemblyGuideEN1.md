Step by step instructions for building the Spartan Respirator OpenVentilator

Make sure you have all the parts listed in the parts list. We will start with
the bellows.

1.  **1 - PNEUMATIC BELLOW SYSTEM** â€“  
    First you need to cut the inner tube of a car tire. The distance between the
    cuts has to be 29cm. It is very important to make parallel cuts and not
    radial ones, to keep the shape of the bellow as cylindrical as possible.  
    Of course this is just a palliative solution, to be used if you are unable
    to apply any other means of mechanical ventilation.

2.  Once the cuts are made, insert the bottom disk of the bellow. This is the
    disk that has two holes in the diameter of you tubing, and a central hole of
    8mm for fixing a screw. When inserting the disc into the cut tire chamber it
    is important to keep the imaginary line between the two holes for the tubing
    parallel to the tangent line of the outside of the tire. This will ensure
    that the curvature of the tire does not lead to too much deformation when
    the bellow is compressed.  
    A tip you can follow is to insert the disc completely into the chamber and
    rotationally on the axis of the diameter. Adjust the edges of the rubber so
    that it is no more than 2 centimeters from the circumference of the acrylic
    disk, this is very important to guarantee the volume of the bellow.

3.  After inserting the disc, cut a small 2cm diameter rubber disc, try to cut
    it round and cut a second hole inside the 2cm disc with an 8mm diameter.
    This small disk will be used as a seal or O-ring to prevent air leakage
    between the inside and the outside of the disk.

4.  Insert the screw into the diaphragm that you have just cut 2cm in diameter.
    It is important that the screw head is on the rough side, the smooth side of
    the diaphragm should touch the smooth part of the acrylic disk of the
    bellow.

5.  Insert the screw with the diaphragm, inside the air chamber and through the
    bottom disk that you installed in step 2.

6.  Take the acrylic base and fit it to the disk assembly with the tire and the
    screw.  
    Insert the washer with a screw nut through the pivot part of the base. Make
    sure that the hole for the pipe in the base is aligned with the hole for the
    pipe in the disk.  
    Tighten the nut and washer, make sure the top of the bellow is free and use
    a wrench to hold the screw head while using another wrench to turn the nut
    at the base. Note that the rubber can expand at this stage. This will ensure
    that the system is airtight.

7.  Insert the PVC connections into the slot holes inside the tire chamber and
    through the base. It is recommended to cut 2 rubber O-rings as you did in
    step3. Fit these o rings to the connection. Check if your connection is too
    long to match the length of the thread. Make sure the connections are not
    sticking into the bellow for more than 1cm, because this will reduce the
    ability of the upper disk to go down. If you have to cut the connections for
    this, use a hand saw. Fasten the external threads of the PVC connection.
    These connections should be tight enough to help apply force together with
    the central screw.

8.  Once the external connections are fitted, you can place two 90 degree PVC
    elbows or bends where the tubing will be connected later.

9.  Now comes the part that needs some style and a little patience. In the same
    way as we did in step 2, 3 and 4 for the bottom disc, we will now install
    the top disc, but this time we cannot reach inside the bellow. You will,
    however, be able to hold the screw through the rubber of the bellow. Insert
    the screw with the diaphragm into the bellow and leave it loose for now.

10. Insert the first upper disk into the bellow. Unlike step 2 you don't have to
    worry about aligning the rubber at this point. Don't forget to keep the two
    centimeters as the maximum distance between the edge of the rubber and the
    circumference of the disc.

11. Hold the screw that is loose inside the bellow with your fingers, squeezing
    through the rubber; make it go through the center hole of the disk you just
    inserted in step 10. After making the screw pass, attach the upper pressure
    disk.

12. Place the nut with washer on the top disk screw, it is important to note
    that you will not be able to use a tool in this case on the screw head as
    there is a risk of damaging or tearing the rubber chamber, so you must use
    some type of pliers or pressure element on the part that is outside the
    bellow in order to prevent the screw from turning while tightening the nut.

13. Assembly of the actuating arm of the bellow. Place the central spacer on the
    acrylic bars; insert the 4 M3 screws and the nuts with washers.

14. Mounting the linear guides. You will first need to place 2 linear bearings
    per axis. Use the 3D printed parts to place two linear guides. Half of each
    guide will be outside the height of the acrylic. Secure with 4 M3 screws,
    nuts, and washers on each side.

15. Assembly of the actuated arm on the top screw of the bellow. Insert an M8
    nut into the central spacer of the actuator arm. Insert the screw into the
    socket. To facilitate assembly, we recommend that you rotate the complete
    actuator arm instead of just the part inside the spacer, this way you will
    be able to align the screw with the nut much easier.

16. ASSEMBLING THE FRAME.  
    Now let's assemble the frame. We will start at the base with the 4 corners
    printed on the 3D printer. The process of assembling the base is similar to
    the process of assembling a PRUSA MK2. If you haven't read that, here is the
    link: https://manual.prusa3d.com/Guide/2.+Y-axis+assembly/298?lang=en. One
    of the differences is that you need to assemble the front and rear part it
    must be assembled first i.e. connect the front and rear 8mm bar first. After
    that, you can mount the 10mm threaded rods. We recommend that you leave only
    an 8mm rear bar to avoid hindering the passage of the tubing later. At the
    front you can place 2 8mm bars without problems.

17. The 10mm bars must pass through the acrylic frame. Don't forget to put
    washers and nuts on the acrylic frame.

18. Before screwing the 10mm nuts and washers on the front of the base, be sure
    to add the support parts that will allow the chassis to stabilize when the
    piston moves in the frame. This is the FRONT part of the respirator as the
    tubing and bellows will come out from the rear.

19. Add the 3D printer parts at the top of the chassis frame, using M5 screws,
    nuts, and washers.

20. Fit the base with the bellow to the frame of the chassis. The base must be
    inserted into the chassis diagonally. Once inserted into the chassis, it
    must be aligned horizontally with the support surface.

21. You can attach the acrylic base to the respirator base with hellerman tapes.

22. When the acrylic base has been installed in the frame, assemble the supports
    of the linear axes, also with M5 screws, nuts and washers. If you do this
    step earlier, you will have problems when fitting the base to the chassis,
    so it is important that you follow this order.

23. Install the stabilizer bars using a threaded M8 rod, 4 nuts, 4 washers,

24. Insert the linear axes through the upper axle support, do not insert all the
    way to the bottom yet.

25. Insert the linear guides of the actuation bar into the axles. Note that the
    side of the nuts must be opposite to the side of the chassis so that there
    is no friction between the actuation bar and the chassis.

26. Push the linear axes to the end of the lower support. Fix the axles with M3
    screws.

27. We will now make the fixture for the windshield wiper DC motor. First mark
    the drilling points of your engine on a paper template. Before making the
    template, bear in mind that it is important that the motor is as vertical as
    possible so as not to interfere with the stabilizer bar structure from step
    21.

28. Drill the acrylic chassis using the template marked in step 25. Use a drill
    bit with EXACTLY the diameter of the motor fixing screws. Remember that each
    motor requires fastening with screws of different lengths and diameters.

29. Using a drill bit slightly larger than the one used for drilling to make a
    recess so that the heads of the screws do not stick out of the acrylic. It
    is recommended to make this recess not too deep so that it does not weaken
    the acrylic structure.

30. FIXING THE MOTOR and MECHANICS.  
    On the crank disc that will be attached to the motor, place the screw that
    will be used to transmit the force of the disc to the connecting rod that
    will act on the bellow arm. Do not forget to insert a washer to prevent
    forcing the structure.

31. On the motor shaft, and depending on the size of the shaft, you may need to
    use a washer or a piece of metal to prevent the crank disc from overlapping
    the motor shaft. Place the volume adjustment cut in the most vertical
    position possible. Attach the crank disc with nut and washer.

32. Fix the connecting rod to the actuator arm with a screw. Always use the
    lower connecting rod hole for this.

33. Manually pull the actuating arm to the position of maximum expansion of the
    bellow. It is important not to stretch the rubber more than necessary. Mark
    the point that will be used on the connecting rod, insert the crank disc
    screw.

34. Fix with nuts and washers.

35. Now put the machine down and finish the fixing with the PVC pipes of air
    inlet and outlet of the bellow. Keep in mind that they cannot be overly
    long. Try to limit the excess volume in the tubes and hoses. Cut two tubes
    of approximately 35 to 40 cm and insert into the curves previously installed
    in step 7.

36. At the end of the outlet tube installed in step 35, place a PVC "T" type
    connector. The two outlets of the T should be parallel to the machine's
    support base, in order to minimize folds in the tubes.

37. Make the connection of the 2 threaded gloves at each outlet of the T to
    connect the spike, make the same connection on the air inlet tube with a
    threaded connection and a spike.

38. Return the machine to the support position on the floor / base.

39. Connect a 10 cm piece of vinyl hose and also one of the flow valves to the
    inlet system, after the flow valve place a spike and a T. This is where the
    oxygen cylinder will be connected in the future.

40. In the bellow air outlet system, after T, connect one of the outputs to the
    high pressure valve system. It comprises a flow valve and a long tube of
    approximately 1.5...2 m as can be seen in the design diagram. 30 to 60 cm of
    this hose will be submerged in the tube with bleach.

41. The other outlet port of the T must be connected to the high pressure port
    of the diverter valve. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THERE IS NO VALVE BETWEEN
    THE HIGH PRESSURE INPUT OF THE DIVERTER VALVE AND THE BELLOW!!!

42. Connect the outlet of the peep valve on the diverter valve assembly to a
    tube of approximately 1m long. Mark a scale on it using a ruler and a pen at
    5cm intervals. Do not write any numbers yet, just mark the lines every 5cm

43. In the air inlet system of the bellow, before the flow valve in the T
    connection, connect the vinyl hose directly to the automatic bypass inlet of
    the diverter valve.

44. EXHAUST FILTER SYSTEM. Cut the 100mm diameter tube to a length of
    approximately 1m.

45. Insert the O-ring of the 100m tube cap, or use PVC glue to seal the cap on
    the BOTTOM BACK so that we can fill it with bleach.

46. Drill 3 holes in the other available 100mm cover. 2 of these holes should
    match the outside diameter of the vinyl hose. The other will be the chlorine
    filter exhaust system.

47. Insert the cover without the O-ring or glue, as it must be removable for
    cleaning the exhaust system and inserting the sponge and lamp. You will be
    able to fill it after this step with diluted bleach.

48. In the cap, insert the two hoses of the patient's ventilation system, one of
    them will be the PEEP valve, the other will be the over-pressure safety
    system. Check the difference between the chlorine / bleach level and the
    maximum part of the tube. We recommend that you keep a distance of 10cm from
    the maximum level of the bleach to the top of the tube so that when bubbling
    occurs, this does not run the risk of spilling out. Mark the number 0 on the
    10cm scale, that is, on the second line drawn in step 42. Starting from the
    0 write 5, 10, 15, 20... etc. cm on the scale drawn IN BOTH THE HOSES. The
    over pressure hose will always be used at a pressure higher than PEEP and
    the PEEP valve will always be operated at the clinical levels recommended
    for the patient. This will be the distance from the tip of the hose to the
    bleach / chlorine solution.

49. Connects an HME filter (Heat and moisture exchange filter) to the patient
    outlet. This item is to reduce evaporation loss on the patient's exhalation.
    It is disposable, so only connected when using the device on a patient.

50. ELECTRICAL PART

51. A computer power supply has several wires. It is important to understand the
    purpose of each of them. In general, every ATX power supply will have ONE
    GREEN WIRE, several BLACK WIRES (ground), Yellow wires that supply 12V, Red
    wires that supply 5V, and Orange wires that supply 3.3V. Solder the switch
    or on-off button to the black and green wires wire of the power supply. This
    will turn the system on and off.

52. In one of the
