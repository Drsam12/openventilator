*OPEN-SOURCE VENTILATOR FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES*

For a standard build, read this [Complete Assembly GUIDE and Manual](OpenVentilator.io_Spartan_Model_Documentation.pdf)

If you build this standard Sparan model, the frame, bellows and valve block will look like this:

Next to the standard build, we have been working on various other ways to get a working system. For example if you have no way to cut acrylic, needed for the standard Acrylic Frame and Bellows, you can choose an alternative design for a flow driver. You can even make one with a wooden frame. To explore those alternatives, you need to browse the various directories in the git repository (which you are probably browsing now).

The system as a whole consists of the following sections, each of which is a directory.

These sections correspond to the directories on this git repository. Each of the sections is necessary to create a working system. Go to the directories to explore the various developed solution:

- [Intake](01_Intake/)
- [Flow Driver](02_FlowDriver/)
- [Pneumatics](03_Pneumatics/)
- [Exhaust](04_Exhaust/)
- [Electronics](05_Electronics/)
- [Accessories](06_Accessories/)

For connections to the patient, we advise to use standard medical parts. If these are not available, maybe there are some parts in the Accessories directory that can help you out.
