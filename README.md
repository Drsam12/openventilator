> Welcome to the OpenVentilator project. This is an OpenSource Ventilator / Mechanical Respirator for the Covid-19 Crisis.

This initiative as well as [OpenLung](https://gitlab.com/open-source-ventilator/OpenLung) was born on the [Open Source COVID19 Medical Supplies](https://web.facebook.com/groups/opensourcecovid19medicalsupplies/) Facebook Group by the awareness on creating a Ventilator solution for the scarcity plaguing our society world wide. I contacted Jeremias Almada from Argentina who by that time had presented an Ambu solution and a Cad Design. The idea was interseting but needed improvments

## Main Goal

Design, Build, Validate and Supply reliable Ventilation Medical Equipment for regions/countries in dificult economical situations.

> **The equipment must have as few industrial parts as possible. If necessary, industrial parts must be easily accessible, even in small towns and villages.**

The equipment should be built independent of the main motor or the ventilation tool (AmbuBag, Bellow etc) to increase modularity of the parts and resources. The equipment can be built with as few tools as possible, and even with the use of scrap to facilitate access to materials.

**Thechnical features are still being decided**, the ventilator has not being validated yet.

## Technical & Medical Requirments ( MVP )

- [x] Adjusting the ventilation volume 200ml ~ 900ml </br>
- [x] Ventilation frequency adjustment 10~25/min </br>
- [x] Adjusting the proportion between inhalation and exhalation 1/1 ~ 1/6 </br>
- [x] Inlet air filtration </br>
- [x] Inlet air humidification </br>
- [x] Filtration of the exhaust air system with anti-contamination sanitary standards </br>

## Risk Control

- PEEP Valve control between 1mm/h20 ~ 40mm/h20
- Mechanical Volumetric Ventilation Adjustment
- Filtration of air to reduce contagion risk
- Sanitary Regulation [Brazil Regulations](http://www.in.gov.br/en/web/dou/-/resolucao-rdc-n-356-de-23-de-marco-de-2020-249317437?fbclid=IwAR3tQyhVUPMqrTcX5HAW9Tq7MfYLCYCk8IwH2yqnO6RuaKEyzOCC9ImPHMI)

## Success Criteria
