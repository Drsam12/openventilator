# OpenVentilator

### Welcome to the OpenVentilator project!

> Based on the information given by Jeremias Almada from Argentina we are developing an OpenSource Ventilator for the Covid-19 Crisis.

The idea is to provide a **reliable source of ventilation for people in dificult economical situations.**  
The parts are made to be easilly found, thechnical features are still being decided, the ventilator has not being validated yet.

This initiative was taken by Jeremias who I Contacted for information on the project and that asked me on a way of making the project OpenSource.
