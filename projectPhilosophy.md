## Before attempting to make a new project or re-inventing the wheel ##
Please read how ventilators used to work on the 50s and even before.
 
[A little bit of history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilator) 

[for those that forgot](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6489151/) 

[that our reality exist!](https://scholar.google.com.br/scholar?q=challenges+of+icu+in+poor+public+health&hl=pt-BR&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart)


Any complaints about the safety and usage of those machines should have been made 70 years ago, when many ventilators started to surge. 
Today rich regulation agencies talk about sanitary standards and forget that the poor don't even have soap on their countries. This is the typical genocide atitude. 
Many people have said that our machine can't be used in a ICU (WE DON'T WANT EVEN TO USE THIS MACHINE at all) but the truth We should ask is how many people in the world have access to an ICU? 

The current health and economical system just shown us how they FAILED to provide Health to everyone. 

Tipically and also, please notice that electronic and fancy projects from today are not scalable as they should to provide an "emergency solution" for the Covid-19 crisis AROUND THE WORLD. 

Also we strongly believe that a pandemic like this should have a GLOBAL solution as it is a GLOBAL problem. 

Is very easy to manufacture a machine in a country with GPD per capita of 100.000 dollars while in the majority of the world is suffering and literally sufocating on poverty!

Any person we reasonable knowledge about and how a ventilator works can make a ventilator. The problem is NOT AN ENGENEERING PROBLEM, it is a scale and logistics problem. We can't even provide sanitary toilets to some countries, and there is people trying to send ventilator?
