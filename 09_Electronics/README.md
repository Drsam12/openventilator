Following the principles of this project, we tryed at maximum to make it manufacturable all over the world. With that in mind we try to use the basic eletronic components and present lots of options for the same solution.

This way we see that each group could assembly it as best as possible choosing from the options available.

Also, the project was created with diferent versions in mind with diferent features, from the low one to the "higher" end.

The circuit was design using easyEDA, so it is sharable and editable.

Following the block diagram its much easier to understand all parts of the circuit.
