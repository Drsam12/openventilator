In this directory you can find information, schematics and PCB designs for the electronics parts. They are one part of the system as a whole. To get an overview of the system as a whole, see the [toplevel description](../SystemDescription.md) or the [assembly document](../Assembly.md).

## What's here

The project's main Spartan design uses the circuit in the SpartanControl directory. It offers separate control of the speed of the motor during the inspiratory and expiratory phases. The circuit was design using easyEDA, so it is sharable and editable. [Go to this directory for more info about it](SpartanControl). 

However, you can try an alternative electronics solution. Check for each solution of you can find the parts needed for it. Most use very basic electronics components, so they can be built in many places in the world.

You will also see that some electronics solutions offer slightly different features, from low end to high end. The high end solution (with Arduino) is not finished at the time of writing this.
