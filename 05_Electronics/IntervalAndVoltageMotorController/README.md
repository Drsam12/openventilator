![](../../images/OpenVentilatorLogoSmall.png) **OPEN VENTILATOR**

This directory contains a simple driver to control the motor voltage, and allow for an interval before doing the next stroke.

**This part is not part of the standard Spartan model.**

It sets a single adjustable motor speed. After one revolution, the motor will halt for an adjustable time. This way, respiratory rate and I/E ratio can be set (although not directly). 

Easily accessible parts have been used. The most difficult one may be the windscreen wiper interval module, which has to be a certain type. The voltage regulator is capable of 5A of current.

**WARNING: THIS CIRCUIT DOES NOT HAVE ANY ALARMS AND THEREFORE IS UNSAFE TO USE**

This circuit uses the following schematic. Read the build description to read how to connect and modify the interval module etcetera.
