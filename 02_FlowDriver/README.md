![](../images/OpenVentilatorLogoSmall.png) **ASSEMBLY GUIDE OF THE OPEN VENTILATOR - FLOW DRIVER SECTION**

In this directory you can find the build descriptions and parts files for various flow drivers (or pumps). They are one part of the system as a whole. To get an overview of the system as a whole, see the [toplevel description](../SystemDescription.md) or the [assembly document](../Assembly.md).

## What's here

The flow driver section basically moves air. It is capable of generating at least 50 cm of pressure. The toplevel design of the machine is such that the flow driver should always move a constant volume at a time. This is adjustable, but normally constant. 

The flow driver's speed can be controlled down by means of very simple electronics (in the Spartan version). With that electronics, the inspiration and expiration time can be set separately. See the electronics section for more information on that, and the top-level design document.

If you have a design for a flow driver that would fit in, please let us know.
