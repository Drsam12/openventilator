This directory contains documentation on an alternative bellow design made of parts that can be bought at a do-it-yourself shop.

**This part is not part of the standard Spartan model.**

This flow driver does not give a phase signal (such as present in the Spartan model), indicating whether the device is in the inspiration or expiration phase. This should switch every 180 degrees, and it can be used to create two motor speeds. If you know a good and simple way to add it, let us know.

Follow the [build instructions](Instructions.md) to build it.
