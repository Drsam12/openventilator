![](../../images/OpenVentilatorLogoSmall.png) **OPEN VENTILATOR**

This part is about the acrylic frame and its bellow. It is a flow driver (or pump), and the frame also allows mounting some of the other parts of the system to it, such as the valve block and the electronics.
To get an overview of the system as a whole, see the [toplevel description](../../SystemDescription.md) or the [assembly document](../../Assembly.md).

## Design

You can find the sources of the frame and bellows online on Onshape. 
You don't normally need these.

## Build Instructions

1. Laser cut the Acrylic parts the DXF directory. 3D-print the printable parts in the STL directory.

1. Cut the [o-rings you will need](O-Rings/CuttingOrings.md)

1. Start the [1st part of the Gantry assembly](Gantry/GantryAssembly.md)

1. Do the [Bellow Assembly](BellowAssembly/BellowAssembly.md)

1. Complete the gantry with the [2nd part of the Gantry assembly](Gantry/GantryAssembly.md#gantry-assembly-part-2-after-bellow-assembly)

1. Install the Base and start the [Frame Assembly](Frame/FrameAssembly.md)

1. Install the [Motor](Motor/MotorAssembly.md)

After this create all other needed parts, such as electronics and pneumatics. See the [toplevel assembly](../Assembly.md).
