**Bellow Assembly**

Start by assembling the bottom part of the Bellow. The Base and the Disk should press the Car Tire Chamber on each other. This pressure will garantee that there is no leakage. Also notice the importance of the O-rings and washer as they will also guarantee that air doesn't leak in the system.

The Begining by the base is because the top part must me tighten by rotating the base of the gantry that will be screw to the disk set in the top part of the bellow. If you assemble the top part first you won't be able to screw the tubing connections that are in the bottom part. Please follow the steps as shown on the figures

After passing the Screw trough the base you can tightit a little just hold firmly in place the disk
