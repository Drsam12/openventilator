In this directory you can find the build descriptions and information for the parts of the air/O2 intake section. They are one part of the system as a whole. To get an overview of the system as a whole, see the [toplevel description](../SystemDescription.md) or the [assembly document](../Assembly.md).

## What's here

The intake section takes care of having clean air with optionally O2 mixed in that is ready to go to the patient. At the very least, this requires a filter. 

**We do not recommend using bubbling in water or any other type of humidification with water as the medium may be conducive to the reproduction of bacteria and fungi.** Instead, use an HME filter at the patient side.

If you have an easy way to build an air filter with parts available anywhere, let us know. First have a look at the filter directory.
