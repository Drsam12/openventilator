We strongly recommend that you adopt an inlet air filtration system.

Depending on the situation you face, you may be able to find a HEPA filter (such as those used in standard N95 hospital masks) which would be ideal. However, we have seen that because these filters are manufactured with large industries, you may not have access to this type of solution.

IN THIS CASE WE LIST SOME OPTIONS

- 1 Coffee Filter (made of paper and widely available) [Melitta Bentz](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melitta_Bentz), for which we have a [filter "housing"](Instructions.md).
- 2 Automotive Air Filter. Probably a more viable option than option 1 mainly because it does not reduce flow. There are flat and round car air filters. Flat filters need a 3D printed enclosure. Round filters can be screwed between 2 plates.
- HEPA filter, such as the one that [Open-Mask.org](http://open-mask.org) is using: [Panasonic 86889 / Kenmore 40324](https://www.kenmoreoutlet.com/products/kenmore-style-40324-hepa-vacuum-cleaner-exhaust-filter)

If you have a good design, let us know.

**We do not recommend using bubbling in water or any other type of humidification with water as the medium may be conducive to the reproduction of bacteria and fungi.** Instead, use an HME filter at the patient side.
