# Build procedure

Time: 0:05 to 0:10

Create/saw a piece of 80 mm 19 mm tube. 

Mark a hole inside the cap such that a pipe put in a hole there will just touch the outside of the cap (see further pictures).

Glue the pipe in by first putting it in too deep. Put glue on it, and quickly but carefully pull it out to the final position while rotating slightly.
