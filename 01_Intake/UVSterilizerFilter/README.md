We recommend although we know that many of the people who will try to reproduce the project do not have access to this item, so we leave it optional *  We recommend a filtering chamber (e.g. a 100mm PVC tube) prior to the air pumping system (bellows) with UV-C light which is widely used for filtering and sterilizing water in aquariums. This lamp is not easy to find but it can be used **VERY CAREFULLY**  

First, take into account that a high frequency arc can produce OZONE which is a toxic gas for any living being. This, if it enters the patient's air and lung pathways, could kill him.  

**IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT YOUR LAMP DOES NOT PRODUCE OZONE**
