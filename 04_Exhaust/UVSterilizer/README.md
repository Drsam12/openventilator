This directory contains information on how to use ultra violet light to clean the exhaust air. The part is to be placed after the water column, before the air is exhausted. 

## On UV-C light

The idea is that all outgoing air is passed past a UV-C light, which sterilizes it. 
There are two types of UV-C lights, the ones that generate ozone (because 185 nm light comes out), and the ones that don't (185 nm is filtered out). 
Make sure you have one that **DOES NOT generate ozone**, is it is very bad for health. 

Best is to run a hose from the output of the water tank to a tube or container with the lamp inside. 
The lamp should not be visible, because the invisible UV-C light is bad for the eyes and skin. 
The air has to run through the lamp container and after that it's best to vent it outside the building 
(though normally not necessary, it's safer if the lamp fails). Multiple PEEP tanks can be connected to one lamp. 
If you connect a lot of PEEP tanks, choose a bigger lamp.

There are two types of supplies for the lamps: high and low voltage.

## 1. 110V/230V supply

Choose a tube lamp between 6 and 12 W. For safety, the lamp should preferably not be too close to the 
water column. If possible connect the lamp to a separate group with a separate Residual Current Detector, 
so if it fails, it doesn't pull the power on the ventilators. 

A good choice is an aquarium UV-C cleaning lamp, which have hosetails on the housing already. However, the lamp in may need to be replaced by one that does NOT generate ozone. Ozone generation is not a problem under water, so generally these lamps don't filter the 185 nm light that is responsible for ozone generation.

## 2. 12V supply

These lamps are difficult to find, but can be composed of two parts that are easy to find. 
Part one is the housing and inverter, these can be taken from a model for boats and caravans, and just remove the normal 
tube. Part two is the UV-C tube, which should be a fitting 6W or 8W tube. Because of the low voltage and the isolation 
from the 110V/230V mains voltage, it is safer. And power supplies will normally recover from a short circuit.
